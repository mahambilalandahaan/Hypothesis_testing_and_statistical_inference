## üß† Overview

This repository contains **practice notebooks** for **hypothesis testing and statistical inference**, part of Week 9 Day 4 exercises.  
All examples are implemented in **Python** using `numpy`, `scipy.stats`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.  
Visualizations are included to help understand **rejection regions**, **test statistics**, and **p-values**.

## üìÅ Folder Structure & Notebooks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `z_test_practice.ipynb`
- **One-Tailed Z-Test:** Test if sample mean is significantly higher or lower than population mean.  
- **Two-Tailed Z-Test:** Test if sample mean is significantly different (higher or lower) from population mean.  
- **Features:** Rejection region visualization and observed Z-value display.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `t_test_practice.ipynb`
- **One-Sample T-Test (One-Tailed):** Test if sample mean differs in a specified direction.  
- **One-Sample T-Test (Two-Tailed):** Test if sample mean differs in any direction.  
- **Independent Two-Sample T-Test:** Compare means of two independent groups (e.g., male vs female scores).  
- **Features:** Histograms, mean lines, t-distribution plots, p-value interpretations.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `chi_square_test_practice.ipynb`
- **Chi-Square Test for Independence:** Test association between two categorical variables.  
- **Features:** Contingency tables, chi-square statistic, p-value, and bar chart visualizations.

## üìå Key Concepts
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Z-test, t-test, chi-square test  
- **Test Types:** One-tailed, Two-tailed, Independent samples  
- **Statistical Interpretation:** p-value, z-statistic, t-statistic, significance level (Œ± = 0.05)  
- **Visualizations:** Sampling distributions, rejection regions, observed statistics  

---

## üõ† Tools Used
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- SciPy (`stats` module)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Open each `.ipynb` notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code / Jupyter Lab**.  
2. Run all cells to see **calculations, interpretations, and visualizations**.  
3. Modify sample data to practice on new examples.

---

## üí° Notes
- Each notebook has **clearly labeled sections**: Problem, Code, Interpretation, and Visualization.  
- Visualizations reinforce **statistical intuition** and help **interpret results easily**.
